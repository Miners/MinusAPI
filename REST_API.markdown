The REST API
============

Overview
========
At the lowest level, Minus exposes its API with a REST, http-accessible, API. To make it easier for application builders, we will be providing Python, .NET, Ruby, and other API's in the near future.

This file documents the REST API.

The API
=======
We have designed our API to allow you to easily create galleries and upload files programmatically. There are currently 8 APIâ€™s published with more to come in the near future. The API is open and no registration is required.

Please subscribe to our http://blog.minus.com for any updates regarding our API and contact us if you have any questions.

CreateGallery
====================

* http://minus.com/api/CreateGallery

Description
----------------

* creates a gallery on the server side and returns the editor and reader id. The editor id combined with the key can be used to upload images into the gallery. 
* On return, the gallery can be immediately viewed on the web site.

Example
-------------
A call returns the below HttpResponse.

	{"editor_id": "eBYwRX", "reader_id": "eBYwRX"}
	
The gallery can be viewed via http://min.us/meBYwRX or http://minus.com/meBYwRX (by adding an **m** before the reader_id).
Galleries can no longer be edited in any browser via their editor_id. As of v2.06, the gallery owner can use the editor_id in the various "edit" APIs (such as UploadItem) to make changes to the gallery, as long as a valid cookie is given along with the request.  The reader_id can also be used instead of the editor_id in any of the Edit APIs.

UploadItem
===================

* http://minus.com/api/UploadItem

Parameters
--------------
* URL should be structured as follows: http://minus.com/api/UploadItem?editor_id=enRlK&key=OK&filename=jcm3U.png
* Body: A standard multipart file POST.
* Should include the **Content-Disposition** header with a value of "**attachment; filename=a.bin**".
* Should include the **Content-Type** header with a value of "**application/octet-stream**".

Result
----------
You can immediately view this picture in any browser by: http://min.us/lcBpkM or http://minus.com/lcBpkM.

	{"id": "cBpkM", "height": 64, "width": 500, "filesize": "1010 bytes"}

Note that you must prefix the id with a /l (if it's an item) or a /m (if it's a gallery) to see access the uploaded item or new gallery.

Example
----------
Note that the editor_id does not have the leading m that is in the page url.

	curl "http://minus.com/api/UploadItem?editor_id=dn48vKBiP3q9&key=OK&filename=min.png" -F "file=@min.png"
